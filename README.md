This project was created as part of a hackathon challenge, where I completed five milestones to build and deploy a fully functional resume builder.

## 🚀 Milestone 1: Static Interactive Resume Builder

In the first milestone, I built the foundation of the project using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. The goal was to create a static resume with sections like:

- Personal Information
- Education
- Skills
- Work Experience

I also added some interactivity by enabling the toggling of section visibility using TypeScript.

## 🌐 Milestone 2: Publishing on GitHub and Host on Vercel

After building the static resume, it was time to share it with the world!

- Published the project on GitHub for version control.
- Deployed the live project on Vercel, making it accessible online.

I also added some interactivity by enabling the toggling of section visibility using TypeScript.


## 📝 Milestone 3: Dynamic Resume Builder with Form

In this milestone, I converted the static resume into a Dynamic Resume Builder. Users can now input their personal information via a form, and the resume is dynamically generated based on the data they provide without the need to refresh the page.

The form collects all necessary details, including:
- Personal Information (Name, Email, etc.)
- Education
- Work Experience
- Skills

## ✏️ Milestone 4: Editable Resume

In this milestone, I added the ability for users to edit their resume even after it has been generated. Users can directly modify sections like Education and Work Experience by clicking on them.

## 🔗 Milestone 5: Unique Path and Shareable Link

The final milestone added a shareable, unique URL for each resume, allowing users to share their resumes with others or download them as PDFs.

### Features:
- Unique URL Generation
- Link Sharing & PDF Download
